    <h1>Getting your credentials.</h1>
    <p> While this part is data sensitive and will require trust from your side,
        I encourage you to confirm your comfort with this process step as this open
        source project is primarily meant as a mockup for a potentially fully verified
        solution instead.
    </p>

    <p> To continue, you must visit your project -> APIs and Services -> OAuth Screen
        Then, please create a Client ID and download+upload the json file for that ID.
        Be VERY careful that you upload the correct json file or the MCP will not be able
        to authenticate your requests properly.
