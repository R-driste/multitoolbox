This script will assist your Gsuite MCP setup processbun
maybe needs an api service?
edit config so that it has the paths then.

Currently the app supports the following three servers:
Google Drive
Google Sheets
Google Calendar
and returns the necessary config for those servers to work with Claude.

How to use it!
Start the electron app and it will guide you through all the steps you need :D thats it. I understand this app can be somewhat of a security concern which is why I'm attaching a demonstration as well but I'm planning to hand it out to my friends to help them set up MCP on their side heheh.

Go to the APP_FILES folder and run npm start. Follow the instructions carefully, once you finish a step you cannot go back.
If the config file doesn't work, please double check that the user details in the config are accurate to the files in the folder.
